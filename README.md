# Final-Project-ERD-group-2

Database Design and Implementation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a relational database for the Queens College semester course scheduling system. The database was designed using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), normalized to reduce redundancy, and implemented in SQL Server. The project includes stored procedures, workflow tracking, and query analysis to support design decisions.

## Project Goals:
Design a normalized relational database for the Queens College semester course scheduling system
Create an ERD representing entities, attributes, and relationships
Implement the database in SQL Server with constraints and data integrity rules
Use stored procedures and workflow tracking to support controlled data loading
Validate design decisions using query propositions and analysis

## Backup File
A SQL Server .bak file is included as the final database backup
The backup can be restored to recreate the complete database schema and data

## Presentations
Presentation 1: Database Design & ERD
Presentation 2: Implementation, JDBC & Workflow
Both presentations include voice annotation describing the project work and design decisions.

## Notes
This project follows the specifications provided in the Project 3 instructions and demonstrates the complete database lifecycle from design to implementation and validation.
